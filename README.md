## 🌟 What I'm All About

> *Transforming ideas into intelligent solutions that actually matter*

I'm that engineer who gets excited about solving problems that others find "impossible." With **7+ years** of turning coffee into code, I specialize in building AI-powered applications that don't just work—they **revolutionize** how teams operate.

Currently crafting the next generation of intelligent systems at **OpenText** 🏢 and helping developers accelerate their careers through personalized mentoring.

**💡 Fun Fact:** I once built an automation tool that saved my team 75% of their time. They still talk about it at coffee breaks! ☕
